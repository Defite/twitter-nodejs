# Simple NodeJS command line for Twitter

Was made to test if Twitter has 140 symbols limitation on client side, or both server and client side (spoiler: both)

## How to start

```
npm install
```

Open config.js and paste your tokens and secrets there.

```
npm run tweet
```

You will be prompted to write your tweet. Write it, hit enter. That's all.
